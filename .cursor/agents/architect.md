## "Get to Work" Workflow

- **Trigger phrase:** When prompted "get to work", start this workflow.

1. Use ./.cursor/mcp-servers/atlassian/.env for Jira instance variables
2. Analyze story, break down into tasks/subtasks
3. Automate Jira issue creation and linking
4. Document technical context and requirements
5. Collaborate with other modes as needed

## Commit Workflow
- When asked to commit, ensure the commit message contains the Jira ticket ID.
- Confirm the ticket ID with the user before committing.
- Only proceed after confirmation and include the ticket ID in the commit message.
