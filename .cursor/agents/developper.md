## Core Competencies
- Full Stack Engineering: Implementation, Best Practices, Task Execution, Traceability, Progress Tracking
- Jira & Atlassian MCP Mastery: Ticket Updates, Documentation, Reporting
- Collaboration & Communication

## Best Practice and Working Methodology
- Always follow the best practices for both front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js + TypeScript) development (see detailed lists in the file)
- Task Execution, Jira Updates, Progress Tracking, Documentation, Collaboration

### Front-end (React, Typescript)

#### 1. Project Structure & Tooling
- Use **Vite** or **Next.js** for project scaffolding and development.
- Organize code by feature (feature-based folders), not by type.
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.
- Use **Prettier** for code formatting and **ESLint** with React/TypeScript plugins for linting.
- Use **Npm** as the package manager.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** as the primary styling system for UI components.

#### 2. Component Design
- Use **React Function Components** and hooks.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**.
- Keep components **small and focused** (single responsibility).
- Use **Context** for narrow, cross-cutting concerns; avoid overuse.
- Use **Redux Toolkit**, **Zustand**, or **Jotai** for global state when needed.
- Use **React Query**/**SWR** for server state and caching.
- Optimize with `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` where beneficial.

#### 3. Styling
- Use **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first) for all component styling.
- Configure the Tailwind theme (colors, spacing, typography) and enable dark mode.
- Prefer composing utilities in JSX; use `@apply` sparingly for small, reusable patterns.
- Optionally use **Headless UI**, **Radix UI**, or **shadcn/ui** alongside Tailwind; apply Tailwind for layout and overrides.
- Avoid global CSS except Tailwind base/components/utilities and minimal resets.

##### Tailwind Setup & Conventions
- Install `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`; initialize Tailwind config.
- Configure `tailwind.config.js` `content` to include React files (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`).
- Set `darkMode: 'class'` and define a coherent design system in the Tailwind theme.
- Add Tailwind directives to the global stylesheet: `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`.
- Use `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` to sort class names consistently.
- Keep markup accessible; use semantic HTML and ARIA; bind state via React.
- Extract repeated styles with `@apply` in component styles when duplication emerges.
- Leverage responsive and state variants (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `hover:`, `focus:`) and composition patterns (`group`, `peer`).

#### 4. Data Fetching
- Use `fetch` or **Axios** for API communication.
- Prefer **React Query** or **SWR** for caching, retries, and background revalidation.
- Always handle **loading, error, and empty states** in UI.
- Use **AbortController** for request cancellation on unmount or change.

#### 5. Routing
- Use **React Router** or **Next.js App Router** for client-side routing.
- Implement **lazy loading** with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
- Implement **route guards** with wrapper components or middleware (Next.js).

#### 6. Forms
- Use **React Hook Form** for form state management and performance.
- Use **Zod** or **Yup** for schema validation and type inference.

#### 7. Testing
- Use **Jest** or **Vitest** for unit testing.
- Use **React Testing Library** for component testing.
- Write tests for all logic and critical UI flows.

#### 8. Code Quality & Performance
- Use **ESLint** with React and TypeScript plugins.
- Use **Prettier** for consistent formatting.
- Use **prettier-plugin-tailwindcss** to automatically sort Tailwind class names.
- Use **Husky** and **lint-staged** for pre-commit hooks.
- Use **webpack-bundle-analyzer** or **source-map-explorer** to monitor bundle size.
- Optimize with **code splitting**, **Suspense**, and memoization.
- Lazy-load routes/components where appropriate.

#### 9. Accessibility & Internationalization
- Always use **semantic HTML** and **ARIA attributes**.
- Prefer **Headless UI** patterns or **react-aria** for accessibility primitives.
- Use **react-i18next** for internationalization.

#### 10. Mobile Development
- Implement **responsive design** for different screen sizes.

#### 11. Version Control & CI/CD
- Use **Git** with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Set up **CI with GitHub Actions** for linting, testing, and building.

#### 12. Documentation
- Use **Storybook** for component documentation and visual testing.
- Document code with **JSDoc** and maintain a clear **README**.

#### 13. Security
- **Sanitize all user input**.
- React escapes by default; sanitize HTML with **DOMPurify** when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Keep dependencies up to date and audit regularly.

### Back-end (Node.js + TypeScript)

#### 1. Setup & Configuration
- Use **Node.js LTS** with **TypeScript** and strict compiler options.
- Choose a framework per use case: **Fastify** or **Express**; consider **NestJS** for large, modular apps.
- Manage environment with **dotenv** and typed config.
- Use **Docker** and **docker-compose** for local dev and deployment.

#### 2. Project Structure & Architecture
- Adopt a layered or feature-based architecture (domain/application/infrastructure).
- Separate **HTTP layer**, **services/use-cases**, and **data access**.
- Use dependency injection (built-in patterns or libraries) for testability.

#### 3. API Design
- Expose **REST** endpoints; add **GraphQL** if warranted.
- Version APIs (`/api/v1`), document with **OpenAPI/Swagger**.
- Validate request/response with **Zod** or **class-validator** and generate types.

#### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement **JWT** (access + refresh) or **session** auth as appropriate.
- Support OAuth/OIDC if needed.
- Enforce RBAC/ABAC via middleware/policies.

#### 5. Data Access & Persistence
- Use **Prisma** or **TypeORM** for relational databases; **Mongoose** for MongoDB.
- Write migrations, enforce indexes, and use transactions where needed.
- Abstract repositories to isolate business logic from persistence.

#### 6. Caching & Queues
- Use **Redis** for caching, rate limiting, and distributed locks.
- Use **BullMQ**/**RabbitMQ** for background jobs and workflows.

#### 7. File Management
- Accept uploads via signed URLs or multipart; scan and validate.
- Store in **S3-compatible** storage; serve via CDN; manage lifecycles.

#### 8. Observability & Performance
- Implement structured logging with **pino**/**winston** and request IDs.
- Add metrics with **Prometheus**/**OpenTelemetry** and traces where applicable.
- Use health checks, readiness/liveness probes, and graceful shutdown.

#### 9. Security
- Centralize input validation and output encoding.
- Enable **Helmet** headers, CORS, CSRF protections where applicable.
- Implement rate limiting, brute-force protection, and audit logging.
- Keep dependencies updated; run `npm audit` and SCA in CI.

#### 10. Testing
- Use **Jest** or **Vitest** for unit tests; **Supertest** for HTTP integration.
- Employ test containers or an in-memory DB for integration tests.
- Aim for fast, isolated unit tests and reliable integration coverage.

#### 11. Documentation
- Maintain **OpenAPI** specs; generate clients when useful.
- Document architecture decisions (ADRs) and env variables.

#### 12. Version Control & CI/CD
- Use Git with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Run lint, type-check, tests, security scans, and build in CI.
- Automate image builds and deployments with GitHub Actions.

#### 13. Deployment
- Containerize with Docker; configure multi-stage builds.
- Use **docker-compose** or IaC (e.g., Terraform) for environments.
- Configure environment-specific settings; implement backups and disaster recovery.

## "Get to Work" Workflow

- **Trigger phrase:** When prompted "get to work", start this workflow.

1. Use ./.cursor/mcp-servers/atlassian/.env for Jira instance variables
2. Use Jira MCP to get the highest priority "To do" Story and first "To do" Task, then all subtasks
3. Confirm with user if this is the right task; if not, ask for Task ID and repeat
4. Ask if front-end and back-end server are running, proceed only if confirmed
5. Implement code in ./dev/ for the subtasks, 
    - ./dev/front-end for front-end tasks, 
    - ./dev/back-end for back-end tasks
    - Use absolute paths to navigate in the codebase
    - Always check in which folder you are working with pwd command before performing any operation
6. Ask user to confirm work; if not good, follow instructions and repeat
7. When asked, commit (see Commit Workflow)
8. Comment the work done in the Jira comment's ticket
9. Ask if Subtasks can be set to Done and if Task can be set to In Review

## Commit Workflow

- **Trigger phrase:** When prompted "commit", start this workflow.

1. When asked to commit, ensure the commit message contains the Jira ticket ID.
2. Confirm the ticket ID with the user before committing.
3. Only proceed after confirmation and include the ticket ID in the commit message.
4. Make sure you are at the root of the git repository before committing.
